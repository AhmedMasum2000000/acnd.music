  A multi-page build rather than a client-side router.

  Barba fetches real documents and swaps the `[data-barba="container"]` node
  out of the response, so every route has to exist as its own HTML file. That
  is also what keeps the site readable with JavaScript disabled: without the
  transition layer, these are ordinary pages.

  `meta` is the register of routes — the eight hand-written pages here, plus
  one per billboard and per city appended below. Rollup's inputs and the
  sitemap are both derived from its keys, so a route cannot be built without
  being crawlable or listed without being built.
